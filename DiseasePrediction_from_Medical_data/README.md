## 📖 Overview
**HealthGuard AI** is a robust machine learning framework designed to assist medical professionals in the early prediction of critical diseases. By leveraging state-of-the-art classification algorithms—including **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**—this system analyzes clinical data to predict the likelihood of **Heart Disease**, **Diabetes**, and **Breast Cancer** with high precision.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Multi-Disease Support**: Specialized pipelines for three distinct medical conditions.
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Automatic handling of missing values (Imputation), feature scaling (StandardScaler), and data balancing.
- **Model Comparison**: Benchmarks performance across 4 top-tier algorithms to select the best predictor.
- **High Accuracy**:
  - 🫀 **Heart Disease**: ~88% Accuracy (Random Forest)
  - 🎀 **Breast Cancer**: ~97% Accuracy (SVM)
  - 🩸 **Diabetes**: ~76% Accuracy (Random Forest)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
